Dear Friend,

Compliments of the season. I am contacting you with utmost confidence
regarding this money transfer opportunity that will be of mutual benefit
to both of us.

My name is Prince John Doe, director of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
I am writing to you concerning the total sum of Twenty-Five Million
United States Dollars ($25,000,000 USD) that belongs to a foreigner
who died in a plane crash.

As the beneficiary of this vast fortune, I need your honest cooperation
to claim this money. The Government of Nigeria has approved this transfer
to a foreign account, and you have been selected as a business partner
to assist in this confidential transaction.

This is a risk-free business proposal, and I can furnish you with
all vital documents to prove the legitimacy of this transaction.
Your private email and contact details are needed to proceed immediately.

Please respond urgently through my private lawyer, as this requires
your immediate attention. God gives everyone a second chance, and this
is yours.

Yours faithfully,
Prince John Doe
Director, Bank of Nigeria

Note: This is 100% safe and no risk is involved.
